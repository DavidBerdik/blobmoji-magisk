### Blobmoji 16, Release 3 Changelog
Blobmoji builds are now based on my [blobmoji2](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2) project since @C1710's Blobmoji project seems to have been abandoned. The `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` file from [here](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2/releases/tag/blobmoji-16r3) was used for this release.

The third release of Blobmoji 16 updates the flag of Syria to be consistent with the flag update to @googlefonts [noto-emoji repo](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji).
