### Blobmoji 16, Release 2 Changelog
Blobmoji builds are now based on my [blobmoji2](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2) project since @C1710's Blobmoji project seems to have been abandoned. The `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` file from [here](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2/releases/tag/blobmoji-16r2) was used for this release.

The second release of Blobmoji 16 updates the designs used for the emojis added to the Emoji 16 standard. Instead of using the designs from the @googlefonts [noto-emoji repo](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji), the blob designs created by @imaddictedtoemojis which were originally shared [here](https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji/issues/163) are now used.
