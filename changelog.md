### Blobmoji 17, Release 1 Changelog
Blobmoji builds are now based on my [blobmoji2](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2) project since @C1710's Blobmoji project seems to have been abandoned. The `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` file from [here](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2/releases/tag/blobmoji-17r1) was used for this release.

This is the first release of Blobmoji 17. The new emoji designs are sourced from the latest update to the @googlefonts [noto-emoji repo](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji) with the exception of the distorted face design (ðŸ«ª), which was created by @imaddictedtoemojis and originally shared [here](https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji/issues/164).
