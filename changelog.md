### Blobmoji 16, Release 1 Changelog
Blobmoji builds are now based on my [blobmoji2](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2) project since @C1710's Blobmoji project seems to have been abandoned. The `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` file from [here](https://github.com/DavidBerdik/blobmoji2/releases/tag/blobmoji-16r1) was used for this release.

I am not an artist and have no interest in designing new "blobby" emojis, so any of the emojis that have been added since the original Blobmoji project ended have the same design as Google's current set, but contributions of blobby designs are welcome! If you are interested in contriubting, please check out the blobmoji2 repo.
